# Notes-application
Simple note taking application built with vanilla JS.

Built this simple note taking application with vanilla JS. 
It features a button for adding notes which redirects to to the edit page for adding title and note body.
I built this as one of the course guide applications in Andrew Mead's modern JS course on Udemy.com
